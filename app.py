# we are creating a game where the user has to choose one of three elements, rock, paper or scissors
# the computer will also choose one of the three elements
# if the user beats the computer, they get one point and vice versa
# if the user and the computer choose the same element, it is a draw
# paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper
# the user will be told if they won or lost
# the user will be able to play again or quit
# the user will be able to see their score
# the game interaction will happen in the terminal
